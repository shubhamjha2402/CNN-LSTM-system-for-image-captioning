# CNN-LSTM-system-for-image-captioning
The goal of the project is to design a CNN-LSTM architecture for the
application of image captioning. The dataset for the image captioning used
is FLICKR8K, which is used both for training and testing our model. In
order to check the performance of our model, BLEU score on test data is
considered as the metric subject to the condition on total model size.
